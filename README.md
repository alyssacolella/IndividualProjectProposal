# Individual Project Proposal: Book Project
### Interactive web app to track reading activity

The open source project I would like to contribute to is called ‘Book Project’. It is a web app, written in Java, that allows users to create an account, add books to read or already read, rate books, view statistics on reading habits, etc. The design is a simple one with navigation to book lists, goals, statistics, and settings. The project implements separate bookshelves, such as ‘to read’, ‘finished’, ‘reading’, etc to filter reading lists for a user. It tracks reading behavior and opinions to produce statistics like average rating, most and least liked book, and longest book read.

For reference, adding a book to a shelf looks like this:

The project can be found here: https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project

## Project Relevance
Written in Java, this project utilizes object oriented design to implement book, author, and shelf objects. Found as an open source project in GitHub, it would be necessary to use Github for version control. A rule of this project is that you have to reach out to the creators to claim issues to fix or propose contributions, which would allow us to practice communication with other coders through Github, as well as aligning ourselves with their other rules, style guides, etc. This project utilizes the GoodReads API to import books, and requires access to a database that stores information on books and authors, which targets two more educational goals of this class. Numerous issues the creators need fixed require knowledge of debugging, JUnit testing, and GUIs. I think all of this is important because we would be given the chance to experience working on a project from back-end to front-end, without the overwhelming amount of work it would be to start something like this from scratch.

## Contribution
My contribtion proposal is to add several features to enhance the user experience. First, I believe it would be valuable to implement Java's timer class to create a feature like "Start Reading Session" that allowed the user to set a timer, in which they would be prevented from using the rest of the app until time was up. At the beginning (and end) of this session, they can log their book and starting page number (and page number reached), so that the statistics and goal tracker may updated accordingly. Furthermore, more statistics could be added to the statistics page, like average rating by genre and active reading times.

If these features leave time to complete additional work, there are also a few issues described on Github that I think could be solved in our timeline. They include a frontend bug with the login page, need for error messages on log in, failing tests, refactoring a few methods to be static, etc.
